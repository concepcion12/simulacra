### 2. Core Components Implemented

#### Agent Architecture
- **Agent Class**: Psychologically realistic agents with:
  - Personality traits (impulsivity, risk preferences, cognitive type)
  - Dynamic internal states (mood, stress, self-control)
  - Behavioral states (habits, addictions, cravings)
  - Action budget system (280 hours/month)
  - Environmental cue processing

#### Behavioral Economics Modules
1. **Prospect Theory**: Asymmetric evaluation of gains/losses
2. **Temporal Discounting**: Hyperbolic discounting with state-dependent adjustments
3. **Dual-Process Theory**: System 1/2 decision making
4. **Gambling Biases**: Gambler's fallacy, near-miss effect, hot hand
5. **Habit Formation**: Exponential smoothing of consumption patterns
6. **Addiction Module**: Tolerance, withdrawal, and craving dynamics

#### Type System
- Comprehensive enums for actions, behaviors, substances
- Data classes for all state representations
- Type aliases for IDs and coordinates
- Outcome types for different actions

### 3. Key Features Working

✅ Agent creation with different personality profiles
✅ Internal state updates (mood, stress, cravings)
✅ Environmental cue processing
✅ Behavioral economics calculations
✅ Action budget management
✅ Addiction and withdrawal mechanics
✅ Habit formation tracking

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Decision-Making System
1. **Utility Calculation**
   - Implement multi-component utility function
   - Financial, habit, addiction, psychological, social utilities
   - System 1 vs System 2 evaluation

2. **Action Selection**
   - Available action generation based on context
   - Utility maximization with bounded rationality
   - Stochastic choice with softmax

### Phase 2: Environment
1. **City Structure**
   - Districts with wealth levels
   - Plots with different building types
   - Spatial relationships and distances

2. **Buildings**
   - Residential (apartments, houses)
   - Employment locations
   - Liquor stores and casinos
   - Public spaces

### Phase 3: Action Execution
1. **Action Classes**
   - Work, Gamble, Drink, Rest, etc.
   - Preconditions and effects
   - Outcome generation

2. **Environment Interaction**
   - Movement between locations
   - Building interactions
   - Social encounters

### Phase 4: Simulation Loop
1. **Time Management**
   - Monthly cycles
   - Action scheduling
   - State updates

2. **Population Dynamics**
   - Multiple agents
   - Social networks
   - Emergent behaviors

### Phase 5: Analysis & Visualization
1. **Data Collection**
   - Agent histories
   - Population statistics
   - Behavioral patterns

2. **Visualization**
   - Agent trajectories
   - Population trends
   - Spatial heatmaps

## Technical Notes

- Using Python 3.13 with numpy
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Type hints throughout for clarity
- Behavioral parameters based on research literature
- Ready for parallelization in future

## Research Alignment

The foundation successfully implements:
- Kahneman-Tversky Prospect Theory
- Quasi-hyperbolic discounting (β-δ model)
- Dual-process cognitive architecture
- Rational addiction theory elements
- Behavioral economics of gambling

This provides a solid base for exploring emergent behaviors in addiction, recovery, and social influence.
