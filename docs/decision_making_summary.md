# Decision-Making System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a sophisticated decision-making system that integrates behavioral economics principles with a dual-process cognitive architecture. The system enables agents to make psychologically realistic decisions based on their internal states, personality traits, and environmental influences.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Action System
- **Action Class**: Represents possible actions with type, time cost, and parameters
- **ActionContext**: Provides context for decision evaluation
- **Action Generation**: Dynamically generates available actions based on agent state

### 2. Multi-Component Utility Calculation

The `UtilityCalculator` evaluates actions across five utility components:

#### Financial Utility
- Uses Prospect Theory for asymmetric evaluation of gains/losses
- Reference point is current wealth
- Expected outcomes vary by action (work income, gambling losses, etc.)

#### Habit Utility
- Based on habit formation theory
- Uses multiplicative model: u(c/h^φ)
- Tracks drinking and gambling habits separately

#### Addiction Utility
- Models shift from positive to negative reinforcement
- Components: euphoria, withdrawal relief, craving relief
- Tolerance reduces euphoria over time

#### Psychological Utility
- Captures mood and stress effects
- Different actions have different psychological impacts
- Work increases stress, rest reduces it

#### Social Utility
- Models social costs/benefits
- Begging has social cost
- Socializing provides benefits (modulated by mood)

### 3. State-Dependent Utility Weights

Weights dynamically adjust based on agent state:
- **High craving** (>0.5): Addiction weight increases, financial decreases
- **Financial pressure**: Financial weight doubles
- **High stress** (>0.7): Psychological weight increases by 50%

### 4. Dual-Process Decision Making

#### System 1 (Intuitive)
- Fast, heuristic-based evaluation
- Driven by cravings, stress, immediate appeal
- Implements cognitive biases (gambler's fallacy)

#### System 2 (Deliberative)
- Slow, utility-maximizing evaluation
- Considers all utility components
- Applies temporal discounting

#### Effective Theta Calculation
System 2 influence (θ) is reduced by:
- Low self-control resources
- High cognitive load
- Strong cravings (>0.7)
- High stress (>0.6)

### 5. Action Selection

Uses softmax (Boltzmann) selection:
- Temperature parameter controls randomness (default 0.1)
- Higher utility actions more likely but not deterministic
- Enables exploration and realistic variability

## Test Results Summary

### Action Generation
✓ Different actions available based on agent state
✓ Employment status affects work availability
✓ Wealth affects drinking/gambling availability

### Utility Calculation
✓ All five components calculate correctly
✓ Values scale appropriately with agent state
✓ Addiction utility shows shift from euphoria to withdrawal relief

### Dual-Process Integration
✓ Intuitive agents (low θ): System 1 dominates
✓ Deliberative agents (high θ): System 2 dominates
✓ Stressed agents: Dramatic θ reduction, impulsive choices

### State-Dependent Behavior
✓ Vulnerable agent with addiction: 68% chose drinking
✓ Weights shift appropriately with internal states
✓ Combined pressures create complex weight patterns

### Environmental Influence
✓ Cues amplify relevant cravings
✓ Decision probabilities shift after cue exposure
✓ Realistic behavioral triggering

## Design Validation

The implementation successfully captures:

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Agents don't always choose optimal actions
2. **State Dependency**: Decisions change with mood, stress, cravings
3. **Individual Differences**: Personality traits create diverse behaviors
4. **Environmental Responsiveness**: Cues trigger behavioral changes
5. **Addiction Dynamics**: Progression from choice to compulsion

## Integration Points

The decision-making system is ready to integrate with:
- **Environment**: Locations provide action targets and cues
- **Action Execution**: Outcomes update agent states
- **Simulation Loop**: Monthly cycles of decisions and consequences

## Behavioral Patterns Enabled

The system can produce:
- **Stress-induced drinking**: High stress → increased drinking utility
- **Loss chasing**: Gambling losses → gambler's fallacy → more gambling
- **Addiction spirals**: Tolerance → increased consumption → stronger addiction
- **Recovery**: Stable environment → reduced cravings → better decisions

## Technical Achievements

- **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and testable
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout
- **Parameterization**: All constants are tunable
- **Performance**: Efficient numpy operations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new actions or utility components

This decision-making system provides a solid foundation for exploring complex behavioral dynamics in the simulation.
